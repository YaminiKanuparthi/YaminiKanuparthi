## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am Yamini Haripriya Kanuparthi
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) at the University of Southern California, driven by relentless curiosity and a passion for innovation. My journey in AI is focused on developing solutions that make a real-world impact. I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science (AI) from Vellore Institute of Technology, where I graduated as the University Gold Medalist (Top Honors), earning the Academic Excellence Award and serving as Program Representative for AI for four consecutive years.

With over 2 years of internship experience at startups and top-tier organizations, including my current role as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Qualetics Data Machines, I've gained invaluable insights. I have also contributed as a Data Scientist Intern at Databeat and as a Software Engineer Intern at JPMorgan Chase and Co., a role secured through my success at JPMC's Code For Good Hackathon (top 5). My research internship at VIT AP resulted in co-authoring papers and presenting at flagship conferences, deepening my understanding and real-world application of AI.

Beyond academia and professional experiences, I've expanded my skill set through hackathons, winning the TechEden National Hackathon and finishing as runner-up in the AIESEC AI Business Hackathon. My leadership skills were honed through roles such as President of the Indian Classical Music Club, Vice President of Sanskriti Club, and Technical Assistant and Spokesperson for the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Club.

I am currently exploring the exciting domain of Large Language Models (LLMs). If you would like to collaborate on a project, please reach out!
